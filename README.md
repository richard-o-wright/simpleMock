## Welcome

Simple Mock is really that simple, just one worker class (with 3 static
methods) and one PoJo.

To get started using it please refer to the examples in the Unit test.

```
{project-root}/src/test/java/net/wrightnz/testing/simple/SimpleMockerTest.java
```

Created because I'm sick of complex heavy weight and unreliable 
mocking libraries making my unit test hard to write and fragile.
I hope you might it useful too!

How to add to your project as Maven dependency:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.wrightnz.simple.testing</groupId>
  <artifactId>simplemock</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
Thanks,
