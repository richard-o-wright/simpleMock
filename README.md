## Welcome
Created because I'm sick of complex heavy weight and unreliable 
mocking libraries making you unit test hard to right and fragile.
I hope you might find this useful also.

Simple Mock is really that simple, just one class with a couple of 
static methods.

To get started using it please refer to the examples in the Unit test.

Thanks,
