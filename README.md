## Welcome
Simple Mock is really that simple, just one class with a couple of
static methods.

To get started using it please refer to the examples in the Unit test.

```
{project-root}/src/test/java/net/wrightnz/testing/simple/SimpleMockerTest.java
```

Created because I'm sick of complex heavy weight and unreliable 
mocking libraries making my unit test hard to right and fragile.
I hope you might find this useful too!



Thanks,
Richard Wright (richard@wrightnz.net).
