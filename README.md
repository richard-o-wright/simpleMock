## Welcome
Simple Mock is really that simple, just one class with a couple of
static methods.

To get started using it please refer to the examples in the Unit test.

```
{project-root}/src/test/java/net/wrightnz/testing/simple/SimpleMockerTest.java
```

Created because I'm sick of complex heavy weight and unreliable 
mocking libraries making my unit test hard to right and fragile.
I hope you might find this useful too!

How to add to your project as Maven dependency:
```
<dependency>
	<groupId>net.wrightnz.testing.simple</groupId>
	<artifactId>simplemock</artifactId>
	<version>0.2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Thanks,
